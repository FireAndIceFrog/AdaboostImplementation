As you can see, this is my implementation of a multiclass adabooster using jupyter notebook.

We were under guidance to complete these models, as you can see there is an adaboost implementation created already - we did this for one of the tutorials.

The real challenge is making a boosting algorithm which is designed for two classes in a classification to suddenly classify many different classes without overfitting.
